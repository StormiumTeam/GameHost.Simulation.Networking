# StormiumTeam Networking

This project was designed for Stormium, but it can be used on other games.  
The backend is for now based on GameNetworkingSockets (with a support for new multiplayer library from unity soon and possibilty to add your own library.).

GameNetworkingSockets: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/GameNetworkingSockets   
Wrapper (I modified it a bit): https://github.com/nxrighthere/ValveSockets-CSharp
